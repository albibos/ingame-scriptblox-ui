# Scriptblox, but in roblox!

a while back, a former scriptblox staff and great lua developer used the scriptblox api to make an ingame ui.
present day, i will be trying to replicate this using the scripts of his work but with a more scriptblox looking gui
it will be made to look mostly like scriptblox, and will be similar to the old one with a better gui
